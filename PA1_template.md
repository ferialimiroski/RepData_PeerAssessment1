## Loading and Processing the data


```r
unzip(zipfile="activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.3.1
```

```r
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
```

```r
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 9354.23
```

```r
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 10395
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

```r
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```

###Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```r
averages[which.max(averages$steps),]
```

```
##     interval    steps
## 104      835 206.1698
```
###`The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set, containing the maximum number of steps is 835.``

##Inputting Missing Values
###1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

```r
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
table(missing)
```

```
## missing
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 15264  2304
```
###2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.


###3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```r
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (averages[averages$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```


###4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```r
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN=sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
mean(total.steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(total.steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```


##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


###1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


###2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was created using simulated data:

```r
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))
        return("weekday")
    else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
        return("weekend")
    else
        stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN=weekday.or.weekend)
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data=filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```
